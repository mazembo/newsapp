The purpose of the newsapp is to automate the reading of news from selected news sites and to present users with a updated list of news items.

The user provides a list of selected news sites and the program fetches all the news items of the day and stores them in DB and in a file.

The user can decide to view this news items or to dispatch them through social media or to display them on another website.


The aim is to help citizens be aware of what is going on in their country... provide organisations and decision makes with a tool that save time. They no longer need to navigate through individual sites... This tool does this work for them... All they now have to do is to read...

The tool will also provide analysis functionnalities in the future and even Machine Learning functionnalities that dig into the data provided by newssites on a daily basis.
